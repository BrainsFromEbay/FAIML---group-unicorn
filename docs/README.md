# Handwritten Digit Recognition Project

This project is a comprehensive study and implementation of various machine learning models to recognize handwritten digits. It explores and compares the performance of different algorithms, ranging from classical machine learning models to deep learning architectures.

The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate a robust system for digit recognition, complete with a user-friendly graphical interface for real-time predictions.

This documentation is structured into several sections, each covering a specific aspect of the project.
